# ResourcesCustom.create!(title:'The New Technology of Crime Prevention', description:'Crime prevention is a concept that has been applied in a number of different ways to
# the problem of crime: it has been used to refer to both activities (e.g. crime prevention programs and/or strategies) and outcomes (e.g. lower levels of crime in communities and/
# or lower levels of offending/re-offending by individuals). In the name of crime prevention, researchers have examined the influence/role of formal social control mechanisms
# (e.g. the deterrent effects of police, courts, and corrections) and informal social control mechanisms, with a focus on the influence (through mechanisms such as attachment,
# commitment, and involvement) of family, peers, school, work, community and the role of shame and belief systems/religion). In addition, crime prevention strategies have
# been targeted on different levels of prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary) and on the need for individual (i.e. private actions), parochial (group actions by neighborhood
# residents), and public actions (i.e. decisions to call the police) to prevent crime.')

# ResourcesCustom.create!(title: "DNA research", description:"Besides using fingerprints, law enforcement agencies

# in many TV documentaries and others items of various channels. It is a fact that no other investigative tool has changed the view point in justice system as much as the use of DNA tests and analysis. DNA analysis gives direction to police forces in investigation process. First of all, DNA analysis can solve lots of difficult cases, especially those that have failed when using other techniques. Secondly, even if there are no witnesses, DNA analysis can provide some additional crime clues of importance. In addition, it also reduces arrests that were implemented wrongly with the use of old techniques. Besides, it improves the reliability of the evidence. Last, but not least, it can depict the connection of one crime case with other cases (Prime
